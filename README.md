# schema_form
HTML form builder based on a JSON file

**Schema Form** is a html form builder based on JSON.
It is on pre-alpha version.

Check `schema_form.js` file for examples of how to structure your json file.
Also, check the following link for a live tester: [http://eduardocamillo.com.br/development/schema-form/](http://eduardocamillo.com.br/development/schema-form/)

Lots of improvements still needed, it was more a single-day test than anything, but the idea is cool.
